## Description

In this project, we implemented a Sticky Navbar that remains fixed at the top of the page as the user scrolls. JavaScript was used to dynamically add/remove a class based on the scroll position, and CSS to style the appearance of the navbar.

## Resources Used

- HTML5: Basic page structure.
- CSS3: Styles and design for the Navbar.
- JavaScript: Logic to make the Navbar sticky.
